What is Machine Learning ?

	The Machine Learning has the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

	It is Branch of Artificial Intelligence 
	
	In another words , Machine Learning Can be explained as , automating and improving the learning process of computers based on their experencies without being actual programmed or without any human assitance.

Machine Learning involves making machine will do things like human do


How Humans brains work ?

    • Brain consists of tiny neurans there are billions of neurons in the brain
      
    • Whenever we think or making decision the chemical signal is generated and these tiny neurans light up






Deep Learning is subset of Machine Learning
